# Scaffold Pack Repository Plugin

The Scaffold pack repository plugin.

based on [draft-pack-repo](https://github.com/draftcreate/draft-pack-repo)

## Installation

Fetch the latest version of `scaffold pack-repo` using

```
$ scaffold plugin install https://github.com/Cheneytt/scaffold-pack-repo
```

## Why a Plugin?

Scaffold Pack Repository Plugin (or `scaffold pack-repo` for short) enables users to fetch, list, add and
remove pack repositories to bootstrap all of their internal and external projects. It is incredibly
opinionated on how to fetch, list, add and remove these repositories whereas Scaffold core does not
care about these concepts.

This also enables the Scaffold community to come up alternative forms of pack repositories by
implementing their own plugin for fetching down these packs, so it made sense to initially spike the
tooling as an entirely separate project.
